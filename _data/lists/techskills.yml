- title: Ruby
  description: |
      The Ruby language is my workhorse scripting language, for both full-fledged applications and impromptu
      utility scripts. I often use Ruby as a glue between scripts from more specialized languages, such as R and SQL.
- title: Ruby on Rails
  description: |
      This is my primary web framework, which I've used to build award-winning in-depth news projects that can handle
      traffic from millions of users. I've also built apps using the more minimalist Sinatra and Padrino frameworks.
- title: Databases
  description: |
      My main production database languages are MySQL and SQLite, which I use as data stores for both web applications
      and large data-mining operations and analyses. I've also used MongoDB for web applications.
- title: JavaScript
  description: |
      Most of my JS work is in user-interface features and visualizations with libraries such as jQuery, D3, and Highcharts. I also
      have some experience with client-heavy frameworks such as AngularJS.
- title: Code and project management
  description: |
      I use git daily for tracking personal and for managing professional team projects and I
      regularly contribute to Github open-source repositories. I have extensive experience in
      test-driven development, particularly with the RSpec and Jasmine libraries.
- title: System Operations
  description: |
      I've deployed, secured, and maintained web sites both on hosted platforms and custom cloud servers, including Heroku
      and Amazon EC2.
- title: PHP
  description: |
      This was my first language for building interactive news projects, including a crime mapper, and I currently use it to maintain WordPress sites.
